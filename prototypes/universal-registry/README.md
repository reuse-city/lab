# Universal Registry of Things

## Description

The Universal Registry of Things is a trusted source of information about how to reuse objects and materials. It offers information about repair, customisation and repurposing of virtually any kind of thing.

Examples of data to be featured:

* Manufacturer
* Support and end-of-life policy;
* Versions and official recalls;
* Price of object offered online (new/used);
* Materials;
* Service manuals;
* Parts;
* Repair tools;
* Tutorials of repair;
* Examples of reuse / upcycling;
* Second-hand market information.

## Prototyping

I started (22.03.2021) modelling the base in this [airtable sheet](https://airtable.com/invite/l?inviteId=inv2pca3eNBmtT4d6&inviteToken=a6a50be7ff210aebd030eefa11c11b7f11833b4be695ab35aa9eb04cd60e877e).

## Session during Mozfest 2021

- Workshop - Sustainability Space
- 2021-03-11, 15:45â€“16:45, Zoom Room 5
- Preparation blog post available [here](../workshops/mozfest/preparation_blog-post.md)
- Session notes available [here](../workshops/mozfest/session-notes.md).

**Session description:**

> The session is planned to be an open discussion about the creation of an open registry of physical objects to support information systems that promote the reuse of materials through repair and repurposing. Some of the issues expected to be discussed are data structure and formats, governance and implications in terms of intellectual property, privacy and security.
> This proposal is based on the original concept idea documented here:
https://is.efeefe.me/concepts/universal-registry-things . It is part of my ongoing PhD research at the OpenDoTT project (Northumbria University / Mozilla Foundation), exploring alternatives for waste prevention in smart cities.
> The main goal of the session is to contribute with a research project exploring ways to promote the reuse of materials in urban environments, and particularly what the role of digital technologies can be. It has a direct connection with sustainability as well as the principles of Mozfest.
> The intention to assess the technical feasibility of creating an open registry of physical objects is one among other building blocks of what will hopefully configure a reuse commons. The outcomes of the session will be integrated with other participatory methods adopted by the project.
> As little as one participant might already bring valuable contributions to the discussion, in which case it would be configured as an unstructured open conversation. On the other hand, if dozens of people show up it will work just as fine. I plan to break the session in 10-15 min blocks that allow to balance between directed discussions and more open interaction.

## Previous work

Building on top of [this concept idea](https://is.efeefe.me/concepts/universal-registry-things), created in an earlier phase of research. I'll keep updating that page as the prototype progresses.
