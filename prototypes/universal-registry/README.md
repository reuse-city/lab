# Universal Registry of Things

## Description

The Universal Registry of Things aims to be a trusted source of information about how to reuse objects and materials. It offers information about repair, customisation and repurposing of virtually any kind of thing.

Examples of data to be offered:

* Manufacturer
* Support and end-of-life policy;
* Versions and official recalls;
* Price of object offered online (new/used);
* Materials;
* Service manuals;
* Parts;
* Repair tools;
* Tutorials of repair;
* Examples of reuse / upcycling;
* Second-hand market information.

The universal registry of things was first articulated as a [concept idea](https://is.efeefe.me/concepts/universal-registry-things) within the OpenDoTT project.

## Prototyping Log

- 13.04.2021. [meeting](../../meetings/20210413-meeting.md) with a single participant. Deep conversations on many levels. My main takeaways: technologies have linkages to the techno-social sphere.
  - Systems view. Flows.
  - Geologists have the sense of deep history. FF Note: deep history of objects, from raw materials to disposed. Like Hesse's [Siddhartha](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52036.Siddhartha) becoming aware of the river.
  - Beyond learning skills, coming to trust on tools and one's abilities.
  - "Trust can not be rooted in the technical. Human, face to face. Dealing with other human beings". FF Note: add to the database the ability for people to make themselves available to be contacted by others interested on this or that object.
  - Facilitate the initial conditions, instead of driving the whole process.
  - Brainstorming on app: You pick up a tool, the app gives you solutions and directions. How to fork this thing. Here's a user story. (FF Note: I had not thought before of using an app to bring info about tools, only objects that could be transformed by tools).
- 09.04.2021, #iotday - During the [first meeting](../../meetings/20210409-meeting.md) of reuse city lab, we have evolved the idea of the universal registry of things being not necessarily one central database, but instead a protocol/standard of information relevant for the reuse of goods and materials. It could potentially be deployed in a distributed way (such as the metadata schemes used by libraries like dublin core, perhaps?), partnering with zero waste initiatives, right to repair legislation and regulations, and other interested parties / contexts.
- 22.03.2021 - Started modelling a base in this [airtable sheet](https://airtable.com/invite/l?inviteId=inv2pca3eNBmtT4d6&inviteToken=a6a50be7ff210aebd030eefa11c11b7f11833b4be695ab35aa9eb04cd60e877e) as an experiment. An evolving list of information fields it should offer will be maintained [here](fields.md).
- I hosted a conversation at [mozfest 2021](https://is.efeefe.me/opendott/mozfest-2021). I had originally intended to focus on the universal registry of things, but spent a good part of the session contextualising my research. That informed my decision to come up with the video fragments for reuse city lab, and allow participants to decide whether they want to watch my longer depictions of activities, contexts and impressions. My session notes are [here](https://github.com/opendott-smartcities/II/blob/main/workshops/mozfest/session-notes.md). The miro board I used for the presentation is [here](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lQITOhI=/).
- I have secured the domain name valudata.org, thinking of potentially renaming the universal registry of things at some point. But I'm not totally convinced of it yet.
