# Universal Registry of Things

## Description

The Universal Registry of Things aims to be a trusted source of information about how to reuse objects and materials. It offers information about repair, customisation and repurposing of virtually any kind of thing.

Examples of data to be offered:

* Manufacturer
* Support and end-of-life policy;
* Versions and official recalls;
* Price of object offered online (new/used);
* Materials;
* Service manuals;
* Parts;
* Repair tools;
* Tutorials of repair;
* Examples of reuse / upcycling;
* Second-hand market information.

The universal registry of things was first articulated as a [concept idea](https://is.efeefe.me/concepts/universal-registry-things) within the OpenDoTT project.

## Prototyping

- I have secured the domain name valudata.org, thinking of potentially renaming the universal registry of things at some point. But I'm not totally convinced of it yet.
- I hosted a conversation at [mozfest 2021](https://is.efeefe.me/opendott/mozfest-2021). I had originally intended to focus on the universal registry of things, but spent a good part of the session contextualising my research. Session notes are [here](https://github.com/opendott-smartcities/II/blob/main/workshops/mozfest/session-notes.md).
- I started (22.03.2021) modelling the base in this [airtable sheet](https://airtable.com/invite/l?inviteId=inv2pca3eNBmtT4d6&inviteToken=a6a50be7ff210aebd030eefa11c11b7f11833b4be695ab35aa9eb04cd60e877e) as an experiment. An evolving list of information fields it should offer will be maintained [here](fields.md).
- During the first meeting of reuse city lab (09.04.2021), we have evolved the idea of the universal registry of things being not necessarily one central database, but instead a protocol/standard of information relevant for reuse of goods and materials. It could potentially be deployed in a distributed way (such as the metadata schemes used by libraries like dublin core, perhaps?), partnering with zero waste initiatives, legislation on the right to repair, and other interested parties.
