> Bioregions are not just geographic locales. They embody the interconnection of our minds and nature’s at a molecular, atomic, and hormonal level. A bioregion, in this sense, repairs the unity of mind and world that has been fractured by modernity.2 A bioregion is literally and etymologically a life-place (in Robert Thayer’s words3) that is definable by natural rather than political or economic boundaries. Its geographic, climatic, hydrological, and ecological qualities—its metabolism—can be the basis for meaning and identity because they are unique. And just as ecological systems are unique to each place, so, too, are the social assets of a bioregion—the individuals, groups, networks, and cultures that make up what Cormac Russell calls its associational life.4 In a bioregion, the word growth takes on a new meaning, which is measured in terms of improvements to the health and carrying capacity of the land, and in the resilience of communities. And because value is created in a bioregion by the stewardship of living systems, rather than the extraction of natural resources, a bioregion frames the next economy, not the dying one we have now.

> By attending to flows, bio-corridors, and interactions inside cities as well as in the countryside, bioregional urbanism9 nurtures the health of the ecosystem as a whole. It thinks about metabolic cycles and the capillarity of the metropolis, in which rivers and bio-corridors are given pride of place.

> As things stand today, circular economy approaches to production combine technical innovation and new business models to close material and product loops. But, just as building new roads increases car traffic, circular economy rebound occurs in the form of leakage—the material impacts of support services that today’s hyper-connected businesses rely on. Energy and resources are needed to get staff to work, collect trash, provide water, ensure sanitation, power the cloud, and so on. We still use more raw materials in the system than can be made available through; there are simply not enough recyclable raw materials to put a stop to the continuously expanding extractive economy.
> A circular bioregional framework could reduce such leakage by making health of place the value benchmark rather than production outputs measured—abstractly—in terms of money and “Gross Value Added.”37 If health of place is to replace money as a shared value metric, we will have to describe and measure “health” with greater precision than we do now.

> Designing for system change, we are learning, involves establishing the appropriate enabling conditions. One important enabling condition is a capacity for ecological thinking, and the ability to see patterns of life as a connected whole.49 Western cultures have lost a sense of connection between humanity, place, and nature—but a cultural yearning to reconnect is widespread. The new priority is relationships. Biologist Andreas Weber’s book Matter and Desire points out that this is how nature works, too—the practice of ecology is “the forging of relationships.”

> The diverse ways poor people meet their daily needs are usually described as impoverished, or lacking in development. But in 35 years as a guest in what used to be called the developing world, I have come to a startling conclusion: living sustainably is second nature for people who cannot depend on the high entropy support systems of the industrial world. Their survival practices have enormous potential today. We need to ask: who has answered a similar question in the past? How might we learn from—and improve—what worked before?

A focus on the local does not mean abandonment of collaboration at a national, regional, European, or continental scale. Most governments focus too much on technology start-ups, it’s true, but below the radar, a growing part of the research ecosystem is advancing with a different set of priorities. Dozens of projects and research networks around the world are looking at land repair, agroecology, food systems, biodiversity, and ecosystem stewardship. Signals of change are also evident in global research ecosystems.
