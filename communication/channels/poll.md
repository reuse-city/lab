# Poll - communication tools

[Form](https://forms.gle/EyXP9MMoDTdN3DpLA) sent to participants and subscribers during the first week. Took responses until April 12th. The results were:

- I prefer to communicate with the group in a discussion list via e-mail 5 votes
- I prefer to communicate with the group via a Telegram group 4 votes
- I prefer to communicate with the group via a Signal group 3 votes
- I donâ€™t have Signal or Telegram at the moment, but I do think a group chat would be better than an email list. I can create an account on either.  1 vote
- Slack or Discord 1 vote

I will then set up a mailing list and a telegram group.
