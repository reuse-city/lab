# Communication channels

After sending out a [poll](poll) to participants, I have set up a Telegram group and a mailing list. Initially I am only inviting participants who have signed up by filling the consent form, but might be changing that policy later on.

There is also a [twitter account](https://twitter.com/reuse_city) and a profile on [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/reuse.city/). I hope to remember to add all the videos to this [playlist on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSHdLCc8rAqvn9bf4-96V3M8k3jdctzz9).
