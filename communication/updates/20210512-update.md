# [reuse.city] closing the lab and more

Hi everyone,

It's been almost two weeks since I sent my last update. Sorry for the apparent silence, but I had to focus on other work activities (we had an important OpenDoTT meeting - things went fine, but I was exhausted).

1. Prototypes/Blueprints

As I mentioned before, an important part of my current research activities is prototyping and experimenting with technology (and policy) that would impact the reuse of materials in cities and regions. Throughout last month I was able to enrich some concept ideas I already had, as well as deciding to already start working on ideas I was keeping for later. I'm focusing on three of them for the time being: the Universal Registry of Things; E-I; and the Transformation Labs.

First, thanks again to those of you who have contributed to the miro board set up towards the end of the lab. I understand on the other hand that most of you did not feel comfortable (or willing) to do so, and decided to try a different approach, with videos presenting what's on the miro board and an online survey about them. 

Here are three videos presenting each of the prototype ideas:

 - [Universal Registry of Things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4wZrwRm3CU)
 - [E-I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYFKYaUSCRA)
 - [Transformation Labs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM--73q8Eq0)

And this is the feedback survey form: (*link removed from documentation*)

(if you can't bear watching me talking for another 35 minutes, you can opt to go through the documentation at your own pace, under the lab [repository on GitHub](https://github.com/reuse-city/lab/tree/main/prototypes/)).

Thanks again for your time. I'm looking forward to have your feedback. The [form] will accept responses until 21.05. 

2. Fab City Summit - let's propose something?

This year's [Fab City Summit](https://summit.fabcity-montreal.quebec/) will happen online in August. There is a Call for Proposals open until June 15th. Is anyone interested in bringing the discussion about reuse in cities and regions to that context? I'd be happy to join forces. Contact me if you'd like to work on a proposal.

3. Migrate this mailing list

Some of you have already shown interest in keeping in contact after the lab in April was over. There are also other people who have subscribed to receive updates. I do see the possibility of our conversation outliving my current research phase, possibly enduring longer than my PhD. While I am happy using an e-mail discussion list to communicate, I'm on the other hand not satisfied relying on my University's Microsoft-based services for that. For that reason, I have set up an independent [mailing list on riseup.net](https://lists.riseup.net/www/subscribe/reuse-city) that will not be related to my research activities. Feel free to add yourself to it already, but I will also send a collective invitation once I send out a general update including those people who are interested in it.

That's it for now. Let's keep working here, in the telegram group and in our own workbenches all around the world.

Best regards,

F
