# [reuse city] lab update - 21.04.2021

Good morning, participants and subscribers of the reuse city lab.

We've crossed the halfway mark, and the lab so far has been very productive. Here's some news.

## Presentations this week

Following last week's call for presentations, six participants picked a time slot. We start this evening (Wednesday) with two presentations; tomorrow morning (Thursday) with one; and finally Friday afternoon with another three (all based on my own timezone, CEST in Berlin).

These sessions are available to those who have filled the consent form at https://make.reuse.city .

## Documenting

I have tried as much as possible to document the three meetings we had so far, on the git repository. These are only first impressions and quick notes. In the future I will go through the recordings and materials and publish more. In any case, even on this limited documentation there is already a large amount of insight. Feel free to have a look and let me know if I missed important parts:

In the coming days I'll be refining the documentation on the prototypes I'm working on, particularly the universal registry of things and E-I:

The lab participants are providing solid feedback and ideas on those, thank you again. Feel free to comment by any means you prefer.

## Video - concept ideas

Yesterday I have posted another video about previous phases of my research. This one is about the concept ideas created in 2020 that inform my currrent activities:

Those of you who want to avoid youtube can find the video on archive.org as well:

That's all for now, I hope to see you in this week's presentations.
