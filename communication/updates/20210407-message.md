# Email to participants - 07.04.2021

Good afternoon,

This message is being sent to everyone who either signed up for the reuse city open co-design lab, or subscribed to receive updates about the project. If you don't want to be contacted further, please let me know by replying to this message.

TL;DR:

1. The lab opens gradually this week and lasts until the end of th emonth. We will meet for the first time this Friday, April 9th, 14h Berlin time (CEST) for our first live workshop. Details will be sent exclusively to those who have filled the consent form. See https://make.reuse.city

2. What is an online co-design lab? Check this video:

3. Please let me know how you prefer to communicate moving forward

Firstly (primeiramente, as we say in Brazil) I want to thank you for your interest. As I believe some of you are aware, the process of a PhD research sometimes makes us unsure whether what we're investigating is even relevant. Just by having your attention so far I'm more excited to keep going.

As you know, the main focus of my research is waste prevention through reuse (by repairing, upcycling or re-circulating goods and materials), and how that may relate to smart cities.

But what is an online co-design lab? I don't know for sure, but I made a video yesterday trying to open this discussion with you. You can find it in any of the options below:

Alternatively, you can have a look at the video's script, which I followed at about 90%:

If we agree that the lab is a way to grow a community to reflect, discuss, experiment and build together, my next question is how we should communicate as a group. I have set up a quick survey about that. Please choose your preferences here before Friday the 9th:

If you are not comfortable using the form above, here's a summary: I am asking whether you want to communicate with other participants outside of the workshop times, and if so what is your preferred way to communicate. Feel free to reply to this e-mail to discuss options.

To those of you who are not yet familiar with what I've been doing, here's a quick summary + links:

This project is part of my PhD research at the OpenDoTT project (Northumbria University / Mozilla Foundation). OpenDoTT is an EU-funded (H2020, Marie Curie) doctoral traninig programme on the "Open Design of Trusted Things", investigating issues of trust and internet health on IoT. My position is supposed to research "smart cities", and over time I have decided to focus on waste. But I'm not at all interested in merely increasing the efficiency of collecting waste to be sent to recycling, landfilling or incineration. I want instead to explore ways to promote the reuse of goods and materials so that they take longer to even be considered waste. And may provide benefits in economic, social and environmental terms as the potential value of discarded materials can be reverted to local groups - small businesses, NGOs, community initiatives.

Here's a summary of where I found myself after reaching the first half of my research period:

I will be online and willing to connect with you all this Friday afternoon, Berlin time. Thanks again for being around.
