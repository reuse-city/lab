# Concept ideas - fragment

Hi, welcome back to the reuse city lab. We are well into our collective exercise to discuss the reuse of goods and materials in cities and regions. It's still time to participate. If you want to join the lab or receive updates, go to the website make.reuse.city to sign up or subscribe.

This is the third fragment of reuse city, a series of videos where I'm reporitng the origins of this lab. You may have seen the other videos where I described the choice of focusing my PhD research on waste prevention, and the two design research studies I  have conducted during my first year of work.

Just a quick recap: with the repair journey I have identified decisions and behaviours people have regarding broken or unused things;

and through interviews with practitioners I started working on an ecosystem mapping.

Those two exercises allowed me to identify four main types of stakeholders potentially interested in reuse through repair and physical transformation

That allowed me to brainstorm what was absent from the map, or still underdeveloped...

which turned into eitgh concept ideas that I will describe today. There is a more detailed description on the web page I made by the end of that phase of research: https://is.efeefe.me/concepts

Some of them woul require a whole new PhD project to be developed (who knows, a post-doc could be on my horizon?). Others are there only to start a discussion and may never evolve into particular initiatives. 

But three or four of them are ideas that I'm trying to move forward in the reuse city lab and other future activities of research. You will probably identify those as I present.

Let's go into the eight concepts then.
