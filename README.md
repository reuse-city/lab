# reuse city lab

The [reuse city co-design lab](https://make.reuse.city) is part of a [PhD research](https://is.efeefe.me/opendott) conducted by [Felipe Schmidt Fonseca](https://is.efeefe.me/) at [Northumbria University](https://northumbria.ac.uk) / [Mozilla Foundation](https://foundation.mozilla.org). It is part of the [OpenDoTT](https://opendott.org) project, funded by European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Skłodowska-Curie grant agreement No 813508.

The main objective of the lab is to engage with people from with diverse levels of experience in different fields of knowledge to contribute ideas to promote the reuse of second-hand goods and materials in cities and regions. Particularly, ways to use digital technologies that provide cities and regions the ability to assess and act on the potential value of materials otherwise discarded. In addition to that, a community of practitioners is expected to grow from the lab and hopefully remain active after it is finished.

Based on the [concept ideas](https://is.efeefe.me/concepts) developed in earlier stages of research, three paths of experimentation are being conducted:

- the [universal registry of things](prototypes/universal-registry/README.md), based on [this draft](https://is.efeefe.me/concepts/universal-registry-things);
- [E-I](prototypes/e-i/README.md) (evaluation interface), a machine (or combination of different machines/applications) to help assess the potential value of discarded, obsolete or broken goods and materials.
- [transformation labs](prototypes/transformation-labs/README.md), public infrastructure for the social reuse of goods and materials.
