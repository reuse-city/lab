# reuse city lab

For the prototyping phase of [my PhD research](https://is.efeefe.me/opendott),
I have organised the [reuse city co-design lab](https://make.reuse.city). The idea is to invite people with diverse fields and levels of experience to contribute ideas to promote the reuse of second-hand goods and materials in cities and regions.

Based on the [concept ideas](https://is.efeefe.me/concepts) developed in earlier stages of research, I expect to explore two paths in parallel:

- the [universal registry of things](prototypes/universal-registry/README), based on [this draft](https://is.efeefe.me/concepts/universal-registry-things);
- [E-I](prototypes/e-i/README) (evaluation interfacing), a machine (or combination of different machines/applications) to help assess the potential value of discarded, obsolete or broken goods and materials.
