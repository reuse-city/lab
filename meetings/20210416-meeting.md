# Meeting - 16.04.2021

We met Friday afternoon (CEST). Three participants (NL, UK, US).

## Notes
- Local repair shop
- Ghana - virtually everything will be reused
- first repair, then sell, then scavenge for parts.
- Hard to find repair/reuse in the US (gave up making pictures in NY; bike repair workshop inaccessible in LA)
- Helsinki - almost industrial vs Havana - side-of-the-road workshops, oral culture 
- EU - decentralized / centralized policy. systems.
- Stamp of approval for re-sale
- COVID - becoming OK to get something from a neighbour
- Precious plastic
- Subsided infrastructure
- Gaming industry
- Doughnut Economy
- Policies / OEM / Education
- Municipal-led reuse centres (FF note: [transformation labs!](../prototypes/transformation-labs/README.md))
- Islands of solutions
- one-stop shops
- registry of things: wikipedia inspired (FF note: not wikipedia - individual, rational - but linux inspired - individual + community + organisations). Instead of avoiding hobbyists, build cooperation between diverse levels of institutional structures and their absence.
- traceability + readability
- forensic architecture
- ability to read / unpack

FF notes, kept for later (not willing to interrupt much): 
- Nantes, Stories. 
- Last [session](20210413-meeting.md) on 13.4: trust.
- Chicken and egg - how to promote systemic change. Role of avant-garde projects / islands of solutions (Amsterdam, Nantes, Helsinki, Sweden, etc) to inspire and justify change in other parts of the world. My experience in Brazil could feed from these examples (the neighbour's grass). OTOH, organic examples of reuse born out of sheer necessity can prove the social benefits - Cuba, Ghana, etc.
- the city as a makerspace
- is it always a good idea to attribute monetary value to things?
- avoid waste management monopoly
