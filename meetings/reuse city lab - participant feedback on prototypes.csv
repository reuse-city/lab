Carimbo de data/hora,,"Description. The Universal Registry of Things will be a trusted source of information about how to reuse things. It will do so by offering information about repair, customisation and repurposing of virtually any kind of good or material. Do you think this kind of development is relevant? Please add your thoughts about how to describe it.","Motivation. The main reason to create a Universal Registry of Things is offering an easy way for interested parties to assess the potential reuse value of things. It answers to the fact that material resources are often wasted due to the lack of information about how they can be reused by individuals, collectives and organisations. Does that make sense to you? Can you see other possible reasons for developing such a database?","Stakeholders. Potential users and actors interested the Universal Registry of Things may be: a. individuals willing to reuse materials in their household or neighbourhood; b. community initiatives of repair, upcycling and redistribution; c. repair professionals; second hand shops and online marketplaces; d. manufacturers; e. waste management department at local authorities / municipalities; f. regional / national zero waste initiatives. Are we missing any other particular group here? Do you see these different stakeholders approaching the registry differently? Please comment.","Development. In order to build the Universal Registry of Things, some technical as well as conceptual challenges must be addressed. How to integrate existing but sparse datasources? What kinds of conflicts of interest may arise? How to handle them? How to ensure lifetime trust for data? What are the possible governance models for the URT? What are the technical specifications, tools, languages and methodologies relevant for its development? Please add ideas or references to help face such challenges.",Use this space to add any comments about the Universal Registry of Things unrelated to the questions above.,E-I on different scales. What of these size/form combinations can you see as relevant for E-I?,"What are the advantages and constraints of each scale (mobile app, workbench, kiosk)? How do they compare to other tools and equipment (real and fictional) in the context of reuse initiatives?","User profiles. Please add your comments about any or all of the possible types of users of E-I: a. Citizen / Household with excess materials or objects in need of repair; b. Citizen / Household willing to acquire goods and materials; c. Community initiative (repair / upcycling); d. Artist / craftsperson looking for materials; e. Organisations in need of affordable goods (nonprofits, schools, community centres, businesses); f. Second hand shop / marketplace; g. Professional repairpeople; h. Local Authority / Municipality. Are we missing someone?","Expected behaviour. 1. Put an object in the machine - screen turn on and shows an image of the object. Once an object is sensed, there are two possibilities.  Case A: known object. Overlay message: ""Object found on database"". Buttons on screen: a. What is this -> navigate to page with description of object (video, images, text, other info); b. What can I do with this -> navigate to page with information  about repair, upcycling, re-circulation, second hand market value and user/reuse stories. Case B: unkown object. Overlay message: ""Object not yet on  database"". Button says ""Add this to the universal registry of things"". Ability to  take picture or shoot video with E-I's camera. Are any other steps missing? Please comment.","Scenarios. As of now, I can see three main ways of interacting with E-I as a workbench machine. The first would use NFC to identify objects. The second would do so by way of computer vision. The last one, in addition to those two, would also allow the user to interact with the machine via voice and audio. How do you feel about these possibilities? What would be their implications in terms of behaviour and use? Do you see a connection with science fiction tropes?

How do you see it relating to other kinds of organisations in cities and regions? Think of reuse centres, makerspaces and repair shops, but also elementary and technical schools, universities, public libraries, hardware stores, waste management facilities and others.",Governance. Please add your comments about themes such as the following examples: 1. Policy for acceptance of materials: anything is accepted? How much is enough (balance potential reuse / hoarding). 2. Associative (members only) / open to public? 3.

They have to be clearly connected in a humane way ...",ISO; multilingual; Appropedia would be one model (that absolutely *needs* to be community-based for relevance and for supporting a human-connection essence to the Registry).,"As a techno-skeptic, URT appears to follow the model of a massive scaling up of what has been, historically, a practice that was more common. That practice, rooted in self-sufficiency, had a home on isolated farms by necessity. Small communities would aggregate with a blacksmith (who could repair metallic objects), a leatherworker, and perhaps a tailor/weaver ... The theoretical scope of the URT is now so large, the question of how to apply limits to it comes up. The most obvious limits are within what materials and objects exactly the community is using in their lives. Simple living makes repair much easier!","Smartphone app: point to object, identify, access information;Workbench machine (being prototyped) for repair shops, makerspaces (transformation labs) and community repair initiatives",,,Many objects (or individual/community repair situations) are not able to be relocated for scanning or ID-ing.

2021/05/14 12:51:42 PM GMT+2,,,,,"Challenges:
1. Licensing content. Much of the information that I as an individual use for repair, was not intended for repairers. For instance electronic component datasheets, and product inboxing/teardown videos on YouTube. It is possible that the content providers may not be willing to give consent.
-> Possible answers to help repair: A. provision of technical documentation should be available as part of the right to repair policies, and funded (if there are some manufacturers asking for paid access to content) as part of the extended manufacturer responsibility.  B. The content is mostly already publicly available (e.g. via datasheet search engines), and the Registry of Things would simply compile them/ references to them.
2. Addressing content at the right level. Some repairs are very complex, or require an education in electronics/clothing/materials, that simply cannot be covered by  repair guide. For example, to fix a laptop that won't switch could be as simple as replacing the battery, or as complex as testing the motherboard, and desoldering/resoldering components on the motherboard
-> Possible answers: Look at how Wikipedia addresses this. Could there even be a Registry of Things in ""Simple English""/Portugese/Swahili etc
3. Repairs are not always accessible to everybody. As in point 2 there can be skill/experience/language barriers, but also, there is access to parts/ equipment that can be an issue. Even something as simple as fabric dye, or paint could be a difficult or scarce commodity in some regions with poor infrastructure. ","Would it be curated centrally, like the ECHA, or in a decentralysed way, like Wikipedia.

Workbench/Kisok is probably the most likely to actually work as a business model.
